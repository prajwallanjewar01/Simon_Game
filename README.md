Simon Game - A Memory Challenge

This project is an implementation of the classic Simon game, where players must repeat an increasingly complex sequence of colors and sounds. The objective is to test and improve memory skills while providing a fun and interactive challenge. As the game progresses, the sequence grows longer, and the pace increases, making it harder to remember the correct order.

Built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, this game offers a simple yet engaging experience for players of all ages. The project demonstrates concepts like event handling, DOM manipulation, and timing functions in JavaScript. It also includes basic styling with CSS for a clean and intuitive user interface.

Features:
Responsive UI with animated color sequences.

Difficulty increases as the game progresses.

Score tracking and game reset options.

Audio feedback for each sequence step.

This repository serves as both a fun game and a learning resource for web development enthusiasts.
